Factory Method Pattern: This pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

Abstract Factory: DocumentFactory defines the createDocument() method, which concrete factory classes implement to create specific document instances.

Concrete Document Classes: Each document type (Word, PDF, Excel) has a corresponding concrete class implementing the Document interface.

Test Class: Demonstrates the creation of different document types using the factory method.
