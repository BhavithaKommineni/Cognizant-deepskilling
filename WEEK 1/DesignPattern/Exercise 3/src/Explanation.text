Builder Pattern: This pattern is used to construct a complex object step-by-step. It allows you to create different representations of an object using the same construction process.

Product Class: The Computer class defines the complex object to be built.

Builder Class: The static nested Builder class provides methods to configure the attributes of the Computer. It maintains a fluent interface by returning this from each setter method, allowing method chaining.

Immutable Objects: The Computer class is immutable since all its fields are final and are set only through the builder.

Test Class: Demonstrates the creation of different computer configurations using the Builder pattern, highlighting the flexibility and readability of the pattern.
